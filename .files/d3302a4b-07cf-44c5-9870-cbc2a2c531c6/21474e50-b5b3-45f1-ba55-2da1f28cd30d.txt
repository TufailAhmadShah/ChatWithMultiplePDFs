effective	communication	of	the	meaning	of	the	text.	The	learned	author	was	kind
enough	to	go	through	my	translation	in	1959	and	it	was	offered	to	the	public
with	his	approval.
During	the	last	two	decades	many	reprints	of	the	1959	edition	have	appeared.	As
the	years	went	by	I	came	to	feel	that	the	translation	needed	further	improvement.

friend	Paul	Moorman,	Editor,	Middle	East	Education	and	a	former	Foreign
Editor,	The	Times	Higher	Educational	Supplement,	for	his	meticulous	assistance
in	revising	the	present	text.	I	would	also	like	to	place	on	record	the	assistance	I
received	from	Khwaja	Abdul	Wahid	and	Ansar	Azam	in	preparing	my	first
translation.	I	cannot	but	record	my	profound	debt	to	Mawlana	Mawdudi	for	the
influence	his	ideas	and	his	noble	example	have	had	on	my	own	life,	in	all	phases
of	its	development	so	far,	and	how	impoverished	I	feel	by	his	departure	from	our
midst	towards	life-eternal.	May	Allah	bless	his	soul	and	enable	his	intellectual
