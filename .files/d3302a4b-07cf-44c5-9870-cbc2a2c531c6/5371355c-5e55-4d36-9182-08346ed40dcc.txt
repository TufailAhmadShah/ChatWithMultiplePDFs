1.	For	a	detailed	discussion	of	the	nature	and	significance	of	Ṣalāh,	see	Maulānā

Worship).	–	Editor.2.	Zakāh	is	not	merely	on	the	cash	balance.	It	is	also	charged	on	gold,	silver,

commodities	can	be	found	in	the	books	on	Fiqh	and	is	not	given	here	for	the
sake	of	economy	of	space.

Dīn	And	Sharīʿah
SO	FAR	WE	have	been	dealing	with	Dīn	or	Faith.	We	now	come	to	a	discussion
of	the	Sharīʿah	of	the	Prophet	Muḥammad	(blessings	of	Allah	and	peace	be	upon
him).	But	let	us	first	be	clear	about	the	difference	between	Dīn	and	Sharīʿah.Distinction	Between	Dīn	and	Sharīʿah
In	the	foregoing	chapters	we	said	that	all	the	Prophets	who	have	appeared	from
