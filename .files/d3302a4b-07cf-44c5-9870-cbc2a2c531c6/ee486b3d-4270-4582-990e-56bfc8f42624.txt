and	gives	it	away	solely	in	the	cause	of	Allah.	In	the	same	way,	in	rendering
God’s	rights	one	has	to	sacrifice	many	of	those	things	which	man	has	in	his
control,	like	animals,	wealth,	etc.	But	God	has	so	formulated	the	Sharīʿah	that
harmony	and	equilibrium	are	established	in	the	different	fields	of	life	and	the
sacrifice	of	others’	rights	is	reduced	to	the	barest	minimum.
This	is	achieved	by	the	limits	prescribed	by	God.	He	has	allowed	us	every
facility	in	the	fulfilment	of	the	obligation	of	Ṣalāh.	If	you	cannot	get	water	for
ablution,	or	you	are	sick,	you	can	perform	tayammum	(dry	ablution).	If	you	are
on	a	journey,	you	can	cut	short	the	Ṣalāh.	If	you	are	ill	and	cannot	stand	in	the
prayer,	you	can	offer	it	while	sitting	or	lying.	The	recitation	of	the	prayer	is	so
manageable	that	they	can	be	shortened	or	lengthened	as	one	may	wish;	at	times
of	rest	and	ease	we	may	recite	a	long	chapter	of	the	Qur’ān,	at	busy	times	we
may	recite	a	few	verses	only.	The	instruction	is	that	in	the	congregational	prayers
and	in	those	prayers	which	occur	during	business	hours,	the	recitation	should	be
short.	God	is	pleased	with	the	optional	devotions	(Nawāfil),	but	He	disapproves
