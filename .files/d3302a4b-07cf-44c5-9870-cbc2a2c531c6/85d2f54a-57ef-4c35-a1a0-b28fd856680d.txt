of	Islam	for	the	ordinary	reader,	particularly	the	young.	It	is	not	written	in	the
browbeating	style	of	theology	books,	rich	in	awe-inspiring	jargon	and	legal
quibbling	but	of	little	help	in	bringing	the	reader	into	direct	contact	with	the
spirit	of	the	faith.
Towards	Understanding	Islam	is	a	religious	text	with	a	difference.	It	offers	a
simple	exposition	of	Islam;	its	approach	to	life,	the	articles	of	its	faith,	its
worship	and	prayers,	and	the	scheme	of	life	which	it	envisages.	The	method	of
exposition	is	steeped	in	the	methodology	of	the	Qur’ān.	It	offers	in	summary
form	the	essential	teachings	of	Islam.	And	as	the	book	is	primarily	meant	for	lay
readers	and	students	no	attempt	is	made	to	burden	the	mind	of	the	reader	with
difficult	or	philosophic	dissertations.	The	language	and	style	of	the	author	are
clear,	candid	and	rational.
Originally	written	in	1932	in	Urdu,	under	the	title	Risālah	Dīniyāt,	the	book	was
intended	as	a	textbook	for	students	of	the	higher	classes	and	for	the	general
public.	It	served	an	important	need	and	became	a	popular	Islamic	reader.	Most	of
the	schools	and	colleges	of	the	Indo-Pakistan	subcontinent	adopted	it	as	a
