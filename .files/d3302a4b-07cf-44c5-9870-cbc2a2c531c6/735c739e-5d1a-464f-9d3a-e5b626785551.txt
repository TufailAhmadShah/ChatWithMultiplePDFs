of	life	in	Towards	Understanding	Islam.	There	must	be	innumerable	other
examples	of	a	similar	kind	and	I	hope	that	the	book	will	be	even	more	effective
in	its	present	form.
The	Islamic	Foundation	envisages	a	comprehensive	plan	to	bring	the	moving
and	inspiring	work	of	Mawlānā	Mawdūdī	before	the	world	at	large,	in	English
and	other	major	European	languages.	Towards	Understanding	Islam	is	only	the
first	step	and	we	hope	that	other	important	books	by	him,	certainly	some	of	the
most	influential	in	our	age,	will	soon	find	their	way	to	thirsty	souls	and	hungry
intellects.
We	pray	to	Allah	to	bless	our	effort	with	mercy	and	acceptance.
