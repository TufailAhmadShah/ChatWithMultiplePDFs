that	was	started	at	the	dawn	of	the	human	era.The	Sources	of	Sharīʿah
We	draw	upon	two	major	sources	to	learn	about	the	Sharīʿah	of	Muḥammad
(blessings	of	Allah	and	peace	be	upon	him),	the	Qur’ān	and	the	Ḥadīth.	The
Qur’ān	is	a	divine	revelation	—	each	and	every	word	of	it	is	from	Allah.	The
Ḥadīth	is	a	collection	of	the	instructions	issued	or	the	memoirs	of	the	last
Prophet’s	conduct	and	behaviour,	as	preserved	by	those	who	were	present	in	his
company	or	those	to	whom	these	were	handed	down	by	the	first	witnesses.
These	were	later	sifted	and	collected	by	divines	and	compiled	in	the	form	of
books	among	which	the	collections	made	by	Mālik,	Bukhārī,	Muslim,	Tirmidhī,
Abū	Dāwūd,	Nasā’ī	and	lbn	Mājah	are	considered	to	be	the	most	authentic.Fiqh
Detailed	law	derived	from	the	Qur’ān	and	the	Ḥadīth	covering	the	myriads	of
problems	that	arise	in	the	course	of	man’s	life	have	been	compiled	by	some	of
the	leading	legislators	of	the	past.	The	Muslims	should	forever	be	grateful	to
those	men	of	learning	and	vision	who	devoted	their	lives	to	gaining	a	mastery	of
the	Qur’ān	and	the	Ḥadīth,	and	who	made	it	easy	for	every	Muslim	to	fashion
