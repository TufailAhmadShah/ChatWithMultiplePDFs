SOME	MAY	THINK	it	pretentious	of	me	to	write	a	foreword	to	a	book	by	an
Islamic	thinker	as	outstanding	in	our	time	as	Mawlānā	Mawdūdī,	especially
when	any	need	to	introduce	the	eminent	author	or	his	remarkable	book	Towards
Understanding	Islam	has	been	magisterially	fulfilled	by	Brother	Khurshid
Ahmad.	Towards	Understanding	Islam	has	already	made	its	mark	and	this
edition	is	only	an	improved	English	version.	However,	I	can	hardly	neglect	this
opportunity	to	express	our	gratitude	to	Allah,	subḥānahū	wataʿālā	for	having
enabled	us	to	bring	out	a	new	revised	version	of	a	book	which	has	so	deeply
influenced	such	a	large	number	of	men	and	women.	Only	recently	I	received	a
letter	from	a	friend	in	Brazil,	saying	how	a	leading	journalist	had	embraced
Islam	purely	because	of	the	simple	and	persuasive	exposition	of	the	Islamic	way
