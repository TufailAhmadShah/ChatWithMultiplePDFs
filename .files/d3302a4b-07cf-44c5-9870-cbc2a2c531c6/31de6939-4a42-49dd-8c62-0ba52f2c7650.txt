revised	the	original	book	and	made	substantial	additions	to	it.	This	revised
edition	of	Risālah	Dīniyāt	has	now	been	skilfully	translated	by	Prof.	Khurshid
Ahmad,	to	whom	my	heartfelt	thanks	are	due	for	this	labour	of	love.	I	am
confident	that	the	book	will	serve	its	purpose	better	in	this	new	form.
My	object	in	writing	this	book	has	been	to	provide	all	those	—	Muslims	and
non-Muslims	alike	—	who	have	no	access	to	the	original	sources	with	a	brief
treatise	giving	a	lucid,	comprehensive	and	all-embracing	view	of	Islam.	I	have
avoided	minute	details	and	endeavoured	to	portray	Islam	as	a	whole	in	a	single
perspective.	Apart	from	stating	what	we	Muslims	believe	in	and	stand	for,	I	have
also	tried	to	explain	the	rational	bases	of	our	beliefs.	Similarly,	in	presenting	the
Islamic	modes	of	worship	and	the	outlines	of	the	Islamic	way	of	life,	I	have	also
tried	to	unveil	the	wisdom	behind	them.	I	hope	this	small	treatise	will	go	far
towards	satisfying	the	intellectual	cravings	of	Muslim	youth,	and	that	it	will	help
non-Muslims	to	understand	our	real	position.
