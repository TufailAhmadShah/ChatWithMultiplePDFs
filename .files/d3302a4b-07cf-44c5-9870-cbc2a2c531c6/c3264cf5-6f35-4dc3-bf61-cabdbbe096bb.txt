the	children	of	Adam.	i.e.	all	human	beings,	respectable	and	dignified.”	The
Qur’ān	again	declares:	“O	ye	people!	surely	we	have	created	you	of	a	male	and	a
female	and	made	you	tribes	and	families	so	that	ye	may	identify	each	other.
Surely	the	noblest	of	you	in	the	sight	of	Allah	is	one	who	is	most	pious,	most
mindful	of	his	duty.	“Similarly,	the	Holy	Prophet	says:	“O	people,	verily	your
Lord	is	one	and	your	Father	is	one.	All	of	you	belong	to	Adam,	and	Adam	was
made	of	clay.	There	is	no	superiority	for	an	Arab	over	a	non-Arab	nor	for	a	non-
Arab	over	an	Arab;	nor	for	a	white-coloured	over	a	black-coloured	nor	for	a
black-skinned	over	a	white-skinned,	except	in	piety.	Verily	the	noblest	among
you	is	he	who	is	the	most	pious”	(vide	Oration	of	the	Prophet	on	the	occasion	of
the	Farewell	Pilgrimage).
This	is	the	clear	truth	which	the	Sharīʿah	told	to	man	more	than	thirteen
centuries	ago,	but	unguided	reason	has	succeeded	only	in	touching	the	fringe	of
it	after	centuries	of	waste,	losses	and	blunders,	after	subjecting	hundreds	of
thousands	of	people	to	indiscriminate	segregation	and	after	degrading	men	and
corrupting	human	society.	The	Sharīʿah	gives	the	simplest	and	the	shortest
