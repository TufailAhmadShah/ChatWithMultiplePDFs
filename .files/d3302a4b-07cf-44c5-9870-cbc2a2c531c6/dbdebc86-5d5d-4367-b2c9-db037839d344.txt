(blessings	of	Allah	and	peace	be	upon	him).	The	teachings	of	Islam	were	made
complete	through	him;	one	basic	law	was	formulated	for	the	whole	world	and	he
was	made	a	Prophet	for	all	mankind.	His	prophethood	was	not	meant	for	any
particular	nation	or	country	or	period;	his	message	was	for	all	peoples	and	for	allages.	The	earlier	codes	were	abrogated	by	the	advent	of	Muḥammad	(blessings
of	Allah	and	peace	be	upon	him)	who	gave	the	world	a	complete	code	of	life.
This	means	there	will	be	no	new	Prophets	and	no	new	religious	code	until	the
Last	Day.	Muḥammad’s	(blessings	of	Allah	and	peace	be	upon	him)	teachings
are	meant	for	all	the	children	of	Adam,	the	entire	human	race.	Now	Islam
consists	in	following	Muḥammad	(blessings	of	Allah	and	peace	be	upon	him),
that	is,	acknowledging	his	prophethood,	believing	in	all	that	he	has	asked	us	to
believe	in,	following	him	in	letter	and	spirit,	and	submitting	to	all	his	commands
and	injunctions,	the	most	fundamental	of	which	is	Lā	ilāha	illallāh	“There	is	no
deity	but	Allah”.
This	brings	us	to	the	question:	what	has	Muḥammad	(blessings	of	Allah	and
peace	be	upon	him)	asked	us	to	believe	in?	What	are	the	articles	of	Islamic	faith?
