unfounded.	Their	claim	is	not	dissimilar	to	the	claim	of	an	ignoramus	who	has
not	seen	an	aeroplane	and	on	that	‘knowledge’	proclaims	that	aeroplanes	do	not
exist	at	all!	Because	somebody	has	not	seen	a	thing,	it	does	not	mean	that	that
thing	does	not	exist.	No	man,	not	even	the	whole	of	humanity,	if	it	has	not	seen	a
thing,	can	claim	that	such	a	thing	does	not,	or	cannot,	exist.	This	claim	is	out	and
out	unscientific.	No	reasonable	man	can	give	it	any	weight.
Now	look	at	the	beliefs	of	the	second	group.	According	to	them,	a	human	being
is	a	human	being	because	in	his	previous	animal	form	he	had	done	good	deeds;
and	an	animal	is	an	animal	because	previously	as	a	human	being	he	had	behaved
badly.	In	other	words,	to	be	a	man	or	an	animal	is	the	consequence	of	one’s
deeds	in	one’s	former	form.	One	may	well	ask	“Which	of	them	existed	first,	man
or	animal?”	If	they	say	man	preceded	animal,	then	they	will	have	to	accept	that
he	must	have	been	an	animal	before	that,	and	was	given	a	human	form	for	its
good	deeds.	If	they	say	it	was	animal	they	will	have	to	concede	that	there	must
have	been	before	that	a	man	who	was	transformed	into	an	animal	for	his	bad
