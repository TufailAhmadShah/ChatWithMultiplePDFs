brain -machine interface. The system involves the implantation of tiny, 
flexible electrode threads into the brain, allowing for seamless 
communication between neurons and external dev ices. These threads are 
much thinner than a human hair and are designed to minimize damage to 
brain tissue during implantation.  
The device, known as the Neuralink implant, is inserted into the brain 
through a minimally invasive surgical procedure. The implant's electrodes 
record and stimulate neural activity, forming a two -way communication 
channel between the brain and external de vices. This direct interface opens    
 
   
 up a world of possibilities, from controlling computers and prosthetic limbs 
with the power of thought to treating neurological disorders at their root.  
Applications of Neuralink Technology:  
â€¢ Enhanced Cognitive Abilities: Neuralink holds the promise of 
augmenting human cognition by enabling direct access to information 
and computational power. This could lead to improved memory, faster 
learning, and enhanced problem -solving abilities. Individuals 
equipped with Neuralink imp lants may be able to seamlessly interact
